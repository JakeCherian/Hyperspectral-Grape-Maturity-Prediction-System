# Hyperspectral-Grape-Maturity-Prediction-System
Developed a non-destructive grape quality assessment system using hyperspectral imaging and a curated HSI dataset to predict key chemical indicators and classify ripeness. A hybrid CNN–BiLSTM model analyzes spectral features, enabling accurate, data-driven decisions in vineyard and winery operations.
